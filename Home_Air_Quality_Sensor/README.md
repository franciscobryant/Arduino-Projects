<h1>Home Air Quality Sensor</h1>

<p>This project is for Singapore-India Hackathon 2019. </p>
<p>It's functionality is : the hardware will get air quality and temperature sensor data, then it will send the data to a server on the internet via HTTP protocol, which will then get rendered on a web-app so that users can see the live data of the sensors wherever and whenever they want to. </p>
<p>The sensors used are MQ135 Gas sensor and DHT22 Temperature sensor. The microcontroller is ESP8266</p>
