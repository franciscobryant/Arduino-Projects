# LED Clock

This is a digital clock for your home by using a LED Matrix. This LED Clock will switch the display on every fixed intervals between : first, the current date and time which is gotten from the RTC module inside. Second, the room's temperature and humidity since we also added a Humidity sensor inside it. Third, a short message that can be customised by the user.

A picture of the LED Clock is shown below. Aside from the electronic component, a casing for it is also made to improve the aesthetics of the product
