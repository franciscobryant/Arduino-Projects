# BedLamp

A bedside lamp that is able to change it's colours whenever a user puts their hands near it's sensors. This lamp has 2 proximity sensors integrated with it, and whenever the sensors detect an input, which in this case is the user's hand, it will tell the Arduino to change the color of the lamp. Since there are 2 proximity sensors, the user will have 2 options of changing the color. The first sensor is to change the RGB values of the LED, and the second one is to change the intensity of the color.
